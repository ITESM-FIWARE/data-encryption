# NGSI-Encryption-Layer-as-a-Service

This document describes the encryption service developed at ITESM as a tool for encrypting and decrypting [FIWARE data models](https://www.fiware.org/developers/data-models/). 

[FIWARE](https://www.fiware.org/) is a curated framework of open source platform components to accelerate the development of Smart solutions. The [FIWARE platform](https://www.fiware.org/developers/catalogue/) provides a rather simple yet powerful set of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that ease the development of Smart Applications in multiple vertical sectors. 

The main and only mandatory component of any "Powered by FIWARE" platform or solution is the [FIWARE Orion Context Broker Generic Enabler](https://fiware-orion.readthedocs.io/en/master/), which brings a cornerstone function in any smart solution: the need to manage context information in a highly decentralized and large-scale manner, enabling to perform updates and bring access to context.

[FIWARE data models](https://www.fiware.org/developers/data-models/) have been harmonized to enable data portability for different applications including, but not limited, to Smart Cities. They are intended to be used together with [FIWARE NGSI version 2](https://www.fiware.org/2016/06/08/fiware-ngsi-version-2-release-candidate/).

The application can be seen as two stand-alone services, one that uses tokens as a security measure and the second one that uses sessions as a security measure. Both stand-alone services enable the encryption and decryption of all up-to-date available FIWARE data models published in [FIWARE Data Models official site](https://www.fiware.org/developers/data-models/). 
First, the overall overview of the encryption service is described; secondly, the stand-alone service that uses tokens is introduced; lastly, the stand-alone service that uses sessions is detailed.

## Overall overview
In the following, the service specifications are described. This specification applies to both stand-alone services mentioned above. 

### Prerequisites
The encryption service can be installed on any Operative System.

The following software must be previously installed in the server which will hold the encryption service.
1. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
1. [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/apps)/[Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download/)

Furthermore, the following ports containers are required.
1. ngsi_nodejs 8000 (only for stand-alone encryption service that uses tokens)
1. ngsi_python 2121 (only for stand-alone encryption service that uses sessions)

### Overall input definition
The inputs that the encryption service expects are listed below.
1. Orion URL Source or a JSON payload
2. Orion URL Sink or a JSON payload
3. User name
4. User email
5. Keys generated by the encryption process
6. Token generated by the encryption service

### Relevant notes
In the following are described several details about the encryption service.

* Due to context broker’s limits on attribute lengths, the encryption algorithm relies on 8-bit keys.
* For each attribute of the JSON payload, a key is generated. All the keys are integrated into a single file. This single file is then sent to the user via email.

### Initial service authentication
The initial authentication procedure carried out by the encryption service is performed via an email verification process. This process allows a user to authenticate itself within the service. It is noteworthy that the authentication procedure currently works only with Gmail accounts. The process is simplified as follows:


```
Input: User name (#3 in the overall input definition section) and User email (#4 in the overall input definition section)
Output: Token generated by the encryption service
```

Postman/Insomnia specifications
```
HTTP endpoint:
	POST
	Uri: http://ngsi-edlayer/signup
	
	Params (Form URL Encoded):
		name: User name (3)
		email: User email (4)
	
	Headers:
		Fiware-Service:'default'
		Fiware-ServicePath:'/'

```

### Services within encryption service
The services that both stand-alone implemented services comprises are:
* Sign up
* Sign in
* Encrypt (Encryption of a local JSON file)
* Decrypt (Decryption of a local JSON file)
* Encrypt/ocb (Encryption of entities from Context Broker URL)
* Decrypt/ocb (Decryption of entities from Context Broker URL)

## Encryption service with tokens
The stand-alone encryption service that uses tokens as a verification measure is described below. First, the instructions to deploy and execute the service are described; then the sign-up, sign in, encrypt, decrypt, encrypt/ocb, and decrypt/ocb processes are detailed. 

### Deployment and execution instructions
The following procedure denotes the instructions to deploy and execute the encryption service that will reside in the server.

1. Locate at the service folder location: ```cd ../NGSI_NODEJS_DOCKER```
